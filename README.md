Firefox in a Container

Docker provides in the meantime support for multiple (non linux) operating systems. Why not isolate the applications in individual containers and run all applications within a container. This way you dont need to look after setups and conflicts between versions, as every poor windows user has for centuries now. Yip, even Windows10 runs within Docker, so have fun with the different repositories which enable you to run applications in a container and make you independent from the majors.
